Manages the full lifecycle of financial data (integration, storage, cleansing, validation, audit, analytics) in one system. Particularly strong for time-series market data (prices, curves) and complex instruments.         | • Specialized in financial data: out-of-the-box rules for validating curves, surfaces, and pricing data<br>• Combines data management with analytics – supports front-office trading, valuation, and risk use cases in one platform<br>• Strong exception handling and audit control (tracks changes with two-user approval for data edits) for governance                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | • Not fully autonomous – flagged data exceptions require manual intervention to correct (human “two-eye” review on outliers)<br>• Smaller vendor in the EDM space, with relatively niche adoption compared to larger providers (focuses on capital markets domain expertise)                       | **Quote-based.** Custom enterprise software licensing (on-prem or cloud); pricing not publicly disclosed (varies by deployment).                                                       |
| **SmartStream AIR** (AI Reconciliations)                 | Cloud-native AI/ML solution for **operational data reconciliation** and quality control. Ingests data in any format and auto-detects matches/discrepancies in seconds without pre-configured rules. Used to validate trade data, reports, or any tabular datasets by leveraging ML to “learn” mappings.                        | • Zero-configuration matching – uses AI to generate reconciliation rules on the fly (no manual mapping needed)<br>• Rapid deployment via SaaS – accessible like a web app, with results in seconds at Tier-1 bank volumes<br>• Cuts manual effort dramatically – automates data validation, reduces reliance on IT teams for building reconciliation processes<br>• Continuously self-improving ML models (accuracy improves as more data is processed)                                                                                                                                                  | • **Scope**: Optimized for reconciliation and data comparison tasks – not a full enterprise data management platform beyond those use cases<br>• Relies on quality of input data – will flag mismatches, but downstream correction of source data is manual (no data mastering capabilities)       | **Subscription (SaaS).** Cloud service with transparent subscription pricing model (monthly/annual). Total cost of ownership is controllable via usage-based subscription.             |
| **Duco**                                                 | No-code **data automation and reconciliation** platform (cloud SaaS) using AI/ML to streamline data quality checks.

Includes support and upgrades by default. (Exact pricing not public; tailored to client usage.) |
| **Beeks Analytics for Markets** (formerly Velocimetrics) | Real-time **market data quality monitoring** solution for trading infrastructure. Captures and analyzes network feed data (packets) to ensure market data speed, completeness, and integrity.
